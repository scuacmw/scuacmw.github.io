I'm addicted to the feeling you get when you finally figure out a solution, similar to the one where your code successfully runs! This past year, I've been working with algorithm efficiency and AI, and although I love it, I can't wait to explore other areas of CS.  In my free time, I enjoy gardening, running, and watching horror movies with friends. I'm so excited to be the President of ACM-W this year and explore our potential in tech as a community.

And so naturally my love for math and logic led me here and I am loving it so far. I am interested in exploring all the fields of computer science especially machine learning and game design.

			<h3>Public Relations</h3>
			<div class="infoPopUp">
				<p>Hello everyone! I’m Varun, a sophomore Computer Science and Engineering student from Los Altos, CA. While I only started coding during the winter quarter of my first year at SCU, I’ve always been fascinated with technology. I’m eager to join BroncoSec as its Public Relations manager this year, as participating in the club helped me develop a budding interest in cybersecurity. Through this role, I intend to introduce other students to BroncoSec and the ever-growing field of cybersecurity. Outside of computer science, some of my interests are music, games, and hanging out with my friends. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions, and I’m looking forward to seeing everyone at our weekly club meetings!

			<div class="infoPopUp">
				<p>Hello, my name is Ethan Sychangco! I am one of your BroncoSec underclassman representatives for the 2022-2023 school year! I am a first-year majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and I am local to the Bay Area. I find interest in all things technology, gaming, and cybersecurity, and I want to bring that excitement to the BroncoSec club. When I am not laser-focused on developing a project, I am probably spending time with family, enjoying game nights with friends, or watching random YouTube videos to take a break from my busy days. I want to make sure all BroncoSec members have their voices heard, and that we can support each other’s passions for cybersecurity. You can reach out to me at any time!
